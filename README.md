- 2020-05-29 10:57 Work/Personal GIT acutallu using it now?

`We’d like you to submit your work as a github repository (or other public source control provider repository) where possible. As you complete the exercise we’d like you to commit regularly, with appropriate commit messages so that we can gain an understanding of the process you used to reach your eventual solution.

If you are not able to provide a link to a repository, then a zip file of the project will suffice.`

**SRA**

Starting point: I'm on a work machine, I don't want to do this as my existing work git user - so I've spent a lot of time fettling to get to a state where I can do this correctly and not impact on my actual work.

What we want is an understanding of how they approach the dev work: We tell them how we like dev work to be approached, and not what our goal is here *'...we’d like you to commit regularly, with appropriate commit messages..'* so I think this wording of this is off. I'd suggest something a bit more:

`We'd like to see how you approach development using source control. Submitting as a git repo, where we can look at your individual commits for example, would be ideal. Whether or not your submission includes source control we will want a discussion about that`
